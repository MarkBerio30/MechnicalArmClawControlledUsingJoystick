A Mechanical Arm Claw controlled by a joystick is a robotic device that allows users to manipulate an arm and claw-like gripper. The arm moves in various directions, while the gripper picks up and moves objects. A joystick controls these movements, with buttons and triggers adjusting speed, direction, and the gripper's actions. Sensors detect joystick movements, converting them into signals processed by a control unit, which directs the arm's motors.
This system is widely used in industries like manufacturing and material handling, offering precise, flexible movement for tasks such as assembly and object placement, enhancing efficiency and automation.
